# computer-vision-hw1

This is a homework 1 for a Computer Vision class. Each task features a problem to be solved on a particular image. 
Problems require implementation of own functions, but OpenCV library methods are available.
The point of this homework was to understand how basic operations are conducted by OpenCV under the hood and learn to appreciate the ready libraries :)
